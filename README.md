# Lotion Plus Project - lotion-plus

**Lotion Plus** is an extended version of the original Lotion project, featuring a robust backend powered by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and enhanced functionality. Here's an overview of what Lotion Plus does and the technologies used:

## Functionality

- **AWS Backend**: The Lotion Plus project incorporates an AWS backend created using Terraform. This backend offers enhanced security and user authentication features, ensuring the safety of user data.

- **User Note Management**: Three AWS Lambda functions are implemented to manage user notes efficiently. These functions interact with AWS DynamoDB, which serves as the database for storing note data.

## Technologies Used

- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Lotion Plus leverages AWS services to build a secure and scalable backend. AWS provides robust features for user authentication, security, and serverless computing through Lambda functions.

- **Terraform**: Terraform is used to create the AWS infrastructure for the backend, allowing for the provisioning and management of AWS resources in a code-driven manner.

- **AWS Lambda**: AWS Lambda functions are employed to handle user note management tasks, providing a serverless and cost-effective approach to executing code.

- **AWS DynamoDB**: DynamoDB serves as the database for storing user notes. It offers seamless scalability and high availability for efficient data management.

The Lotion Plus project represents a significant advancement from the original Lotion app, introducing a powerful AWS backend for enhanced security and efficient user note management. The combination of AWS services and serverless computing makes it a robust and scalable solution for users.
